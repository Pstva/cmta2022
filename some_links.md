Nice ideas of methods for analysis and visualtization of topics obtained from the model trained on different time periods. I once participated in a project for the Faculty of Media on news analysis, coronavirus in the news (smth like this). Ans we used ideas from this paper to build graphs like those in the article and the River Networks (how topics change through time). If someone is interested or it seems that the methods are useful for some project, for example, for a term paper, I can discuss these methods with you.
