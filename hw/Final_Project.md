# Final Project

## Organizational Issues

+ you can do the project **individually or in groups of 2-4 people**.
+ the maximum score 10 can be obtained using any data (ready-made or collected)
+ if you collect data yourself (using the website API or with scraping), I will give you from 0.5 to 2 additional points. 
So, you can get even more than 10 for the project.

**Note** : if you collect the data yourself, you should provide me the code for it. Just send me it before the presentation.
+ you will present your projects on the **exam day on the session week**
  (I believe it will be at the beginning of the session)
+ you can either show a presentation or a html. But, please, hide your code and just show output in the case of html file.
+ Although I won't be very strict with time, let's keep each presentation **up to 10 minutes, plus 5 minutes for questions.**


## Presentation

Unfortunately, it is difficult to come up with clear criteria for such projects. 
Next, I will outline what I expect to see in your presentations. 
However, you can do something completely different from homeworks and practices, and it will be cool.

### 1. Data

Describe your data in short (it is important, do not make spend a lot of time on it, please), where you get it? 
How you get it? How many observations? What extra information about each text do you have and you will use?
How you did you preprocess your data?

Again, all this information can be told in 1 minute within one slide/small part in html. Do not show and describe code for all these things.


### 2. Research Question

Describe what you want to analyze/to do. 
It doesn't have to be a clear-cut research question - it could just be ideas like 
"look at the differences in some groups". 
Also, a valid story for this item can be a text classification task. 
You, in general, may not have any question, if you decide to make some kind of application for something 
(maybe, someone wants to make some kind of bot that performs some actions with text or 
small application with shiny in R).

So, you just need to describe in short what you want to do. And you may also describe your hypothesis for future analysis.

### 3. Main Part

Then, describe what you have done and how it helps you for your task. 
Do not show intermediate results and those things that do not show something important in the context of the task.
+ for example, if you compare 2 groups, simple frequent lists for both groups do not show anything, so there is no need to show it.
+ again, no strict criterias and the score for this part will depend a bit on what the other groups have done.
+ the maximum score can be obtained by applying more interesting methods and testing more interesting hypotheses. 
For example, if you compare 2 groups you can just use methods from practice on contrastive analysis or 
you can also try to use topic modelling for the whole corpus and compare topics distribution for these groups. 
I believe it is clear that for the second option, the score will be higher, 
since the methods are more difficult, and more interesting differences can be found using topic modeling.
+ However, even simple methods can pretend on high grade if use them for more interesting hypotheses. 
That is, if you have a clearly formulated idea and it is checked even with the help of simple unigram / bigram calculations, 
then this can also get a high grade. 
For example, you think that some words represent some concepts, and you explain why you think so, 
and you carefully count, for example, changes in the occurrence of these words over time. 
+ Anyway, you can discuss your idea with me and i may give you advice after the second homework. 
+ If your task is just text classification, I expect from you to try different algorithms and to compare their performance.


If you worry that with such vague criteria you can get a bad mark, I will say that, firstly, 
my evaluation of your previous works should have driven away these thoughts. 
And, secondly, I guarantee that with a good description of the data and your task, 
and with adequate application of basic suitable methods from practice, I will definitely grade your project as 7 or higher.
Grades 9 and 10 (excluding data collection bonuses) will be given for the most interesting hypotheses 
and methods for testing them. However, grades 6 and below will be more like a penalty if you missed some very important 
steps for your analysis (for example, you didn’t lemmatize the data when it was needed, although even here I’ll think about it).

### 4. Small summary

Summarize what you have done, what was expected / what was not expected, 
what difficulties arose, what else would you possibly want to do but did not have enough time / effort / understanding how to do it.
